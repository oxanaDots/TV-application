# Expo Router TV demo ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This project uses

- the [React Native TV fork](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos), which supports both phone (Android and iOS) and TV (Android TV and Apple TV) targets
- the [React Native TV config plugin](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/config-tv/tree/main/packages/config-tv) to allow Expo prebuild to modify the project's native files for TV builds

## ðŸš€ How to use

- `cd` into the project

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

##

npx expo run:android
npx expo start --dev-client

## TV specific file extensions

This project includes an [example Metro configuration](./metro.config.js) that allows Metro to resolve application source files with TV-specific code, indicated by specific file extensions (`*.ios.tv.tsx`, `*.android.tv.tsx`, `*.tv.tsx`). The [ExternalLink](./components/ExternalLink.tsx) component makes use of this by having a [separate TV source file](./components/ExternalLink.tv.tsx) that avoids importing packages that don't exist on Apple TV.
